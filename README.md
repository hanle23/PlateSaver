## Inspiration

Save plate is an app that focuses on narrowing the equity differences in society.It is made with the passion to solve the SDG goals such as zero hunger, Improving life on land, sustainable cities and communities and responsible consumption and production.

##What it does

It helps give a platform to food facilities to distribute their untouched meals to the shelter via the plate saver app. It asks the restaurant to provide the number of meals that are available and could be picked up by the shelters. It also gives the flexibility to provide any kind of food restriction to respect cultural and health restrictions for food.
